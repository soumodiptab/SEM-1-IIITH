# DSAPS ASSIGNMENT 1
## Question 1: Big Integer Library
Create a big integer library, similar to the one available in Java. The library should provide functionalities to store arbitrarily large integers and perform basic math operations.

**Operations**:
1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication.
 Eg Input: Negative numbers won’t be present in the intermediate or final output 
(Eg: No need to considercases like)
2. Exponentiation : Base will be a `Bigint` and exponent will be
3. GCD of two numbers.
4. Factorial.

**Note**: For all the operations, input will be such thatthenumber of digits in output won’t exceed 3000 digits.

**Evaluation parameters**:Accuracy of operations and performance.
